# Ebisu Pod

[![Build Status](https://drone.io/github.com/patefacio/ebisu_pod/status.png)](https://drone.io/github.com/patefacio/ebisu_pod/latest)

Support for generating serialization of [ebisu pod data](https://github.com/patefacio/ebisu_pod)

# Purpose

A general purpose *recursive design pattern* for modeling plain old
data components. Think *IDL*, or *json schema* but only covering the
basic data modeling of scalars, arrays, and dictionaries
(a.k.a. objects).

The goal is a simple modeling API that can then be used as inputs to
code generators.


# Examples
